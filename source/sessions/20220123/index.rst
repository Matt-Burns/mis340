CHAPTER 2 - Analyzing the Business Case
---------------------------------------
**Provide responses to the following "Discussion Topics":**

* **The vice president of accounting says to you, the IT director, “This request procedure takes too long. My people know what they are doing, and their systems requests are necessary and important.” She suggests that the IT department bypass the initial steps and immediately get to work on her requests. What would you say to her?**

  * | I would calmly explain bypassing steps now, at the very very start of a project could result in delays that far exceed the time needed to complete bypassed steps. I would give an example like, lets say we skip initial steps in order to save a week's time, and go all the way to production without a hitch. Users of the app start reporting connectivity issues to the point of 30% of them can't even use the app. We quickly figure out that the number of users trying to use the app is greater than the company standard for an app of this type. Expected system performance vs system load is something we talk about during the preliminary investigation (which we all agreed to skip) and it looks like nobody thought to bring it up at a later time. Honest human mistake and we are all at fault. Company policy states we can't release the fix for another 4 weeks. We would have been in a much better position (systems wise, and perceived competence wise) delaying a week and releasing a fully functioning app.

    | But hey it's the VP... she isn't asking she's telling. So I'd "show initiative" and "play with the team" by telling her I'd take a look at it to see what I could do to speed up the "intake process".

* **When setting priorities for system requests, the highest priority goes to projects that provide the greatest benefit, at the lowest cost, in the shortest period of time. How would you reconcile projects that can produce good results in the short term versus projects that can produce excellent results in the long term?**

  * | Personally I think this is where long term goals come in handy. If both projects align with long term goals and you think the company will be around long enough to reap all of the excellent results then I'd say go with whatever project makes the most money per second.
    | If calculating the money per second isn't feasible or if just one of the projects does not align with long term goals then maybe it's time to re-evaluate long term goals until one project completely aligns or aligns significantly better than the other project.

* **The final task in the preliminary investigation is to summarize the results and recommendations in a report and/or in a presentation. Which form of communication, written or oral, do you think is the most effective for conveying your findings to management?**

  * | I'd pick both. In fact I'd go as far to say I'd pick meeting in person to go over the reports as a team. Meeting in person helps people focus attention. Being with them allows you to present the report open and honestly. Concerns can be addressed immediately.
    | If consensus can not be met in the meeting time then everyone will have a copy of the report. The report must present data in a clear, organized, easy to reference way

CHAPTER 3 - Managing Systems Projects
-------------------------------------
**Provide responses to the following "Discussion Topics":**

* **When using a project triangle to illustrate conflicting priorities, Microsoft suggests that if the problem is in the fixed leg, work on the other two legs. For example, if the project must not exceed the budget and it is starting to run over, adjust the schedule, or the scope, or both. However, if the problem is not related to the fixed leg, the adjustment might have to be in the remaining leg. So, when faced with an inflexible budget (fixed leg) and the schedule is slipping (problem leg), the project’s scope (remaining leg) might have to be adjusted. Why is explaining this situation to management sometimes a very difficult task for the systems analyst?**

  * | Management will need to know the chain of events that resulted in delays and why the same chain of events were not accounted for initially. Also they will need to know how the delays are being mitigated.
    | Essentially the analyst needs to explain to management that they are getting less than what they paid for because the team didn't take in to account various factors that lead to delays, all while maintaining managements confidence. It can be a tall order.

* **Consider a scenario where a task is dependent on another task being started but not necessarily completed. For example, a project may depend on a task being started and one-fourth completed before the group could start their portion of the project. Do you think this situation occurs frequently in systems projects? Why or why not?**

  * | I think it happens frequently. Documented tasks often take on the appearance of autonomous units of work that are either waiting to be started (missing dependency), started, or done.
    | Unfortunately tasks are often created such that they present a picture of project work that most members of the team can understand and do not reflect the underlying work that actually needs done.
    | Its a good idea for people with an understanding of actual implementation to distill a set of working tasks from project tasks. Thus project Task A and project Task B can both started even though B is dependent on A.

Reflection
----------
I enjoyed this weeks material. I especially enjoyed thinking about project priorities. I think I have a pretty basic approach to project prioritization. Well basic in that I'm sure I was never given the full picture of any project ever. Still though I'm always glad to say what I think ha. I suppose every organization has it's agenda. I just wish billionaire's weren't so keen on getting more billions, if they could calm down a bit it might make a lot of this project management stuff obsolete at least in the software world.
