Textbook: CHAPTER 1 - Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Provide responses to the following "Discussion Topics":**

* **When team members are geographically dispersed, communication becomes more challenging. Explain how groupware can increase user productivity in this context.**

  * In my experience groupware type apps offer much more than simple text based chat. Groupware typically offers more communication features such as voice/video chat/conferencing. But groupware really shines as a communication capture/organization tool. While facilitating communication groupware can capture and categorize all communication between team members allowing for greater success in documenting and disseminating vital information or work tasks to a large group of people.

* **Under what circumstances should a systems analyst recommend an agile methodology over structured development or object-oriented analysis?**

  * In my personal experience structured development and object orientated analysis works best for teams working in well defined and/or small project spaces. If teams can't quickly and easily agree on basic things such as project due dates, team member work/life balance, or final details of a finished product then structured development techniques run the risk of busying team members with tasks solely required for the techniques process and not the product. Similarly object orientated design systems general disagreements can force team members to spin cycles hashing out disagreements over the smallest of object definitions. Either way company's expose themselves to risks that ultimately delay timelines and add to the bottom line. I feel Agile at least offers team members a chance to sit and discuss the project space in an effort to define projects with clear scope and end goals. Ultimately its up to the team to decide what methodology will work best. However Agile has a slight advantage when it comes to projects that still require many details to be worked out.

* **Rapid advancements in areas such as machine learning and predictive analytics in data science are affecting the daily operations of many IT departments. What should a systems analyst do to stay current?**

  * I think the only way a systems analyst or anybody really can stay current is to immerse him or herself in the technology he or she finds most interesting. Typically this entails having a job working with the technology, or working with the technology in one's free time, or maybe going to conventions to meet others involved with the tech, or I suppose there are internet groups for that kind of stuff now so like join one of those. Anyway have a genuine interest in it and get involved. It's the only way.


Reflection
----------

I have to admit, having a number of years of experience with software development it's hard not to bring my experience to the material. I truly want to see a lot of the software world as it exists now with new eyes. I recently changed employers (regulated institution development to technology driven institution) and feel like I shook off my old mantle in sheer excitement of getting a new one. Unfortunately my real life experience with concepts like The Information Technology Department, The Systems Analyst, and Organizational Information Models have been... bewildering? Bewildering enough to leave me very skeptical about the value some job roles actually provide as well as very defensive of my work time. Anyway, for whatever that was worth that's the bias I'm bringing to the chapter. From my "developer" perspective I feel as though projects only get done when a group of bright, motivated individuals work together to achieve a common goal. I have yet to work in an environment where that has not been so. I don't see how mapping out standard processes for dealing with real life situations leads to bright, motivated individuals working together to achieve a common goal. I have no data to back me up but I think a very large number of projects succeed because of the people and not the process.
