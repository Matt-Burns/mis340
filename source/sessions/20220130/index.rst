CHAPTER 4 - Requirements Engineering
------------------------------------
**Provide responses to the following "Discussion Topics":**

* **Agile methods use rapid development cycles to iteratively produce running versions of the system. How would these shorter cycles affect the ability of the analyst to manage system requirements?**

  * | Agile uses a variation of RAD interviews to produce features, user stories, scenarios, and storyboards.
      The analyst will have to work with the various members of the team in order to produce requirements (features, user stories, scenarios, storyboards) iteratively.
      Some requirements will evolve causing some rework, however if the major requirements are held to the rework generally leads to a better product.

* **A group meeting sometimes is suggested as a useful compromise between interviews and questionnaires. In a group meeting, a systems analyst meets with a number of users at one time. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of group meetings.**

  * | Advantages - interact with many people at once, less formal than individual interviews, huge time savings
    | Disadvantages - less information as those with differing views might not speak up, less information as those with differing views might argue the whole time.
    | Ultimately one is not better than the other, just concentrate on finding the information that will help solve problems at hand.

CHAPTER 5 - Data and Process Modeling
-------------------------------------
**Provide responses to the following "Discussion Topics":**

* **How would you convince management that following a four-model approach is wise?**

  * | Four model approach provides a clear picture of the current system before any modifications are made to it.
      Considering the current system "works" on some level, the team can use the current system as a reference when designing new features or fixing problems for the new system.
      The only drawback is the time it takes to model the systems.
      If I felt the current/new systems had a measure of complexity to them I would certainly push the four model approach as it would save time in the long run.

* **What is the relationship between system requirements and context diagrams?**

  * | Context diagrams is a top down view of an information system showing boundaries and scope.
      System requirements are consulted to determine which entities and data flows to place in the diagram.

Reflection
----------
Chapter 4 got me thinking about my old job. So many processes and procedures and meetings regardless of the design approach. It seemed like no matter what grand new approach was implemented it always equalled the same thing. Meetings and paperwork that took away from development time. Not to mention the added stress. At any rate it really is important to be inspired by the development work because if you aren't and you gotta deal with a maze of process nonsense on top it, you are in bad spot.
